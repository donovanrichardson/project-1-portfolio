# How to get icons from Fontawesome

1. Go to <https://fontawesome.com/start>.
1. Enter your email where it says "Enter your email to create your first kit!" Fontawesome will email you a script tag that you will need to insert into your HTML file in order to use their icons.
1. Check your inbox and follow the directions for inserting Fontawesome's script into your HTML.
1. Now you can use [Fontawesome's website](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=github) to search through hundreds of icons.
1. When you've found the icon that you want, you can click on it and copy its `<i>` tag. It will look something like this:
```
<i class="fab fa-github"></i>
```
